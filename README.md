# Face-mask-detection

In this project, we are designing a system that can detect if a mask is present on the face of
a person in real time. We have used YOLOv3 for human detection, Viola -Jones algorithm for
face detection and a CNN model for mask detection. This system can be very useful for
building automatic doors that can only allow people wearing masks.
